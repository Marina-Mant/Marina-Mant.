## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am a senior student of the department of Statistics and Insurance Science of University of Piraeus. I'm particularly interested in the field of data science, data analysis and machine learning. I created this profile as a way to showcase my humble work during my years as an undergraduate student, but most importantly as a mean to expand my portfolio and create more valuable projects. My journey has only just begun!
That being said, any advice regarding the aforementioned is more than welcome! My experience so far is, unfortunately, only limited to writing on R and using Excel and SPSS. Thus, I am seeking guidance in anything relate to Python for data analysis, SQL, Tableau and Power BI.
